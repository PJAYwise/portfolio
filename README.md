My personal programming portfolio.

Hello World, 

My name is PearlJamie(PJ for short) Wise and I'm a newbie programmer in the Florida Treasure Coast area. I am 21 years old and although I am pretty new to programming, I have been tinkering with the software and hardware of computers and cellphones for a majority of my life.

This right here is my portfolio and I intend on updating it throughout my career as a Web Developer. 

Stay tuned!
